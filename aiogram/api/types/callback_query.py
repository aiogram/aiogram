    This object represents an incoming callback query from a callback button in an inline
    keyboard. If the button that originated the query was attached to a message sent by the bot,
    the field message will be present. If the button was attached to a message sent via the bot
    (in inline mode), the field inline_message_id will be present. Exactly one of the fields data
    or game_short_name will be present.
    NOTE: After the user presses a callback button, Telegram clients will display a progress bar
    until you call answerCallbackQuery. It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling
    answerCallbackQuery even if no notification to the user is needed (e.g., without specifying
    any of the optional parameters).
