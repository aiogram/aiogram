        :param results: A JSON-serialized array of results for the inline query
        :param cache_time: The maximum amount of time in seconds that the result of the inline query may be cached on the server. Defaults to 300.

        :param next_offset: Pass the offset that a client should send in the next query with the same text to receive more results. Pass an empty string if there are no more results or if you don't support pagination. Offset length can't exceed 64 bytes.

        :param switch_pm_parameter: `Deep-linking <https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#deep-linking>`_ parameter for the /start message sent to the bot when user presses the switch button. 1-64 characters, only :code:`A-Z`, :code:`a-z`, :code:`0-9`, :code:`_` and :code:`-` are allowed.
        :param switch_pm_text: If passed, clients will display a button with specified text that switches the user to a private chat with the bot and sends the bot a start message with the parameter *switch_pm_parameter*
