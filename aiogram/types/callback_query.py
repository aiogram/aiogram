It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling :class:`aiogram.methods.answer_callback_query.AnswerCallbackQuery` even if no notification to the user is needed (e.g., without specifying any of the optional parameters).

        Use this method to send answers to callback queries sent from `inline keyboards <https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#inline-keyboards>`_. The answer will be displayed to the user as a notification at the top of the chat screen or as an alert. On success, :code:`True` is returned.

         Alternatively, the user can be redirected to the specified Game URL. For this option to work, you must first create a game for your bot via `@BotFather <https://t.me/botfather>`_ and accept the terms. Otherwise, you may use links like :code:`t.me/your_bot?start=XXXX` that open your bot with a parameter.

        Source: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#answercallbackquery

        :param text: Text of the notification. If not specified, nothing will be shown to the user, 0-200 characters
        :param show_alert: If :code:`True`, an alert will be shown by the client instead of a notification at the top of the chat screen. Defaults to *false*.
        :param url: URL that will be opened by the user's client. If you have created a :class:`aiogram.types.game.Game` and accepted the conditions via `@BotFather <https://t.me/botfather>`_, specify the URL that opens your game - note that this will only work if the query comes from a `https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardbutton <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinekeyboardbutton>`_ *callback_game* button.
        :param cache_time: The maximum amount of time in seconds that the result of the callback query may be cached client-side. Telegram apps will support caching starting in version 3.14. Defaults to 0.
