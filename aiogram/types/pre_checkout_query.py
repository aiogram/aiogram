    This object contains information about an incoming pre-checkout query.
    Your bot can offer users HTML5 games to play solo or to compete against
    each other in groups and one-on-one chats.

    Create games via @BotFather using the /newgame command.

    Please note that this kind of power requires responsibility:
    you will need to accept the terms for each game that your bots will be offering.
