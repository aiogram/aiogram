        - :code:`chat_id`
        - :code:`message_id`
        - :code:`business_connection_id`

        Use this method to delete a message, including service messages, with the following limitations:

        - A message can only be deleted if it was sent less than 48 hours ago.

        - Service messages about a supergroup, channel, or forum topic creation can't be deleted.

        - A dice message in a private chat can only be deleted if it was sent more than 24 hours ago.

        - Bots can delete outgoing messages in private chats, groups, and supergroups.

        - Bots can delete incoming messages in private chats.

        - Bots granted *can_post_messages* permissions can delete outgoing messages in channels.

        - If the bot is an administrator of a group, it can delete any message there.

        - If the bot has *can_delete_messages* administrator right in a supergroup or a channel, it can delete any message there.

        - If the bot has *can_manage_direct_messages* administrator right in a channel, it can delete any message in the corresponding direct messages chat.

        Returns :code:`True` on success.
