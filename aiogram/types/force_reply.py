class ForceReply(MutableTelegramObject):
    """
    Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice `privacy mode <https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#privacy-mode>`_.

     **Example:** A `poll bot <https://t.me/PollBot>`_ for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:

      - Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
      - Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'.

     The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use :class:`aiogram.types.force_reply.ForceReply` in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.
