class SetWebhook(TelegramMethod[bool]):
    """
    Use this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL, containing a JSON-serialized :class:`aiogram.types.update.Update`. In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns :code:`True` on success.
    If you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter *secret_token*. If specified, the request will contain a header 'X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token' with the secret token as content.

     **Notes**

     **1.** You will not be able to receive updates using :class:`aiogram.methods.get_updates.GetUpdates` for as long as an outgoing webhook is set up.

     **2.** To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your `public key certificate <https://core.telegram.org/bots/self-signed>`_ using *certificate* parameter. Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work.

     **3.** Ports currently supported *for webhooks*: **443, 80, 88, 8443**.
     If you're having any trouble setting up webhooks, please check out this `amazing guide to webhooks <https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks>`_.
