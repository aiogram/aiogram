    Use this method to copy messages of any kind. If some of the specified messages can't be found or copied, they are skipped. Service messages, giveaway messages, giveaway winners messages, and invoice messages can't be copied. A quiz :class:`aiogram.methods.poll.Poll` can be copied only if the value of the field *correct_option_id* is known to the bot. The method is analogous to the method :class:`aiogram.methods.forward_messages.ForwardMessages`, but the copied messages don't have a link to the original message. Album grouping is kept for copied messages. On success, an array of :class:`aiogram.types.message_id.MessageId` of the sent messages is returned.
