class SendChatAction(TelegramMethod[bool]):
    """
    Use this method when you need to tell the user that something is happening on the bot's side. The status is set for 5 seconds or less (when a message arrives from your bot, Telegram clients clear its typing status). Returns :code:`True` on success.

     Example: The `ImageBot <https://t.me/imagebot>`_ needs some time to process a request and upload the image. Instead of sending a text message along the lines of 'Retrieving image, please waitâ€¦', the bot may use :class:`aiogram.methods.send_chat_action.SendChatAction` with *action* = *upload_photo*. The user will see a 'sending photo' status for the bot.

    We only recommend using this method when a response from the bot will take a **noticeable** amount of time to arrive.
