# Overview

**aiogram** provides powerful mechanism for customizing event handlers via middlewares.

Middlewares in bot framework seems like Middlewares mechanism in web-frameworks 
(like [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/web_advanced.html#aiohttp-web-middlewares), 
[fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/middleware/), 
[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/middleware/) or etc.) 
with small difference - here is implemented many layers of processing 
(named as [pipeline](#event-pipeline)).

!!! info
    Middleware is function that triggered on every event received from 
    Telegram Bot API in many points on processing pipeline.

## Base theory

As many books and other literature in internet says: 
> Middleware is reusable software that leverages patterns and frameworks to bridge 
>the gap between the functional requirements of applications and the underlying operating systems,
> network protocol stacks, and databases.

Middleware can modify, extend or reject processing event before-, 
on- or after- processing of that event.

## Event pipeline

As described below middleware an interact with event in many stages of pipeline.

Simple workflow:

1. Dispatcher receive an [Update](../../api/types/update.md)
1. Call **pre-process** update middleware in all routers tree 
1. Filter Update over handlers
1. Call **process** update middleware in all routers tree
1. Router detects event type (Message, Callback query, etc.)
1. Router triggers **pre-process** <event> middleware of specific type
1. Pass event over [filters](../filters/index.md) to detect specific handler
1. Call **process** <event> middleware for specific type (only when handler for this event exists)
1. *Do magick*. Call handler (Read more [Event observers](../router.md#event-observers))
1. Call **post-process** <event> middleware
1. Call **post-process** update middleware in all routers tree
1. Emit response into webhook (when it needed)

!!! warning
    When filters does not match any handler with this event the `#!python3 process` 
    step will not be called.

!!! warning
    When exception will be caused in handlers pipeline will be stopped immediately 
    and then start processing error via errors handler and it own middleware callbacks.

!!! warning
    Middlewares for updates will be called for all routers in tree but callbacks for events
    will be called only for specific branch of routers.
