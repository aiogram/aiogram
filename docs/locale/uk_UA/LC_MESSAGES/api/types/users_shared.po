"significant bits and some programming languages may have "
"difficulty/silent defects in interpreting them. But they have at most 52 "
"significant bits, so 64-bit integers or double-precision float types are "
"safe for storing these identifiers. The bot may not have access to the "
"users and could be unable to use these identifiers, unless the users are "
"already known to the bot by some other means."
