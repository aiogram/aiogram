"Identifier of the shared user. This number may have more than 32 "
"significant bits and some programming languages may have "
"difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 "
"significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are "
"safe for storing this identifier. The bot may not have access to the user"
" and could be unable to use this identifier, unless the user is already "
"known to the bot by some other means."
