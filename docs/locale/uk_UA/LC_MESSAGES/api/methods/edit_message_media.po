"Use this method to edit animation, audio, document, photo, or video "
"messages, or to add media to text messages. If a message is part of a "
"message album, then it can be edited only to an audio for audio albums, "
"only to a document for document albums and to a photo or a video "
"otherwise. When an inline message is edited, a new file can't be "
"uploaded; use a previously uploaded file via its file_id or specify a "
"URL. On success, if the edited message is not an inline message, the "
"edited :class:`aiogram.types.message.Message` is returned, otherwise "
":code:`True` is returned. Note that business messages that were not sent "
"by the bot and do not contain an inline keyboard can only be edited "
"within **48 hours** from the time they were sent."
