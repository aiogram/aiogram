"Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display "
"a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's "
"message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to "
"create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice "
"`privacy mode <https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#privacy-mode>`_. "
"Not supported in channels and for messages sent on behalf of a Telegram "
"Business account."

"**Example:** A `poll bot <https://t.me/PollBot>`_ for groups runs in "

"Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll "
