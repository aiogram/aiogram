"Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will remove "
"the current custom keyboard and display the default letter-keyboard. By "
"default, custom keyboards are displayed until a new keyboard is sent by a"
" bot. An exception is made for one-time keyboards that are hidden "
"immediately after the user presses a button (see "
":class:`aiogram.types.reply_keyboard_markup.ReplyKeyboardMarkup`). Not "
"supported in channels and for messages sent on behalf of a Telegram "
"Business account."
