"This version introduces numerous breaking changes and architectural "
"improvements. It helps reduce the count of global variables in your code,"
" provides useful mechanisms to modularize your code, and enables the "
"creation of shareable modules via packages on PyPI. It also makes "
"middlewares and filters more controllable, among other improvements."

"The |Dispatcher| class no longer accepts a |Bot| instance in its "

"Removed global context variables from the API types, |Bot| and "
