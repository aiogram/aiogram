"Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class "
"independent of its dependencies. It achieves that by decoupling the usage"
" of an object from its creation. This helps you to follow `SOLID's "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID>`_ dependency inversion and single "
"responsibility principles."
