"A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: "

"It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number "
"of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another"
" in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is "
"called a transition."
