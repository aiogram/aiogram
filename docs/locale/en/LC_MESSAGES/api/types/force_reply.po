"Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display "
"a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's "
"message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to "
"create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice "
"`privacy mode <https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode>`_."

"**Example:** A `poll bot <https://t.me/PollBot>`_ for groups runs in "

"Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll "

"The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use "
":class:`aiogram.types.force_reply.ForceReply` in your bot's questions, it"
" will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, "
"commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user."
