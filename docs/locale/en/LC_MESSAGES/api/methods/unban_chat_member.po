"Use this method to unban a previously banned user in a supergroup or "
"channel. The user will **not** return to the group or channel "
"automatically, but will be able to join via link, etc. The bot must be an"
" administrator for this to work. By default, this method guarantees that "
"after the call the user is not a member of the chat, but will be able to "
"join it. So if the user is a member of the chat they will also be "
"**removed** from the chat. If you don't want this, use the parameter "
"*only_if_banned*. Returns :code:`True` on success."
