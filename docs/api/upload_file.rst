How to upload file?
###################

As says `official Telegram Bot API documentation <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sending-files>`_
there are three ways to send files (photos, stickers, audio, media, etc.):

If the file is already stored somewhere on the Telegram servers or file is available by the URL,
you don't need to reupload it.

But if you need to upload a new file just use subclasses of `InputFile <types/input_file.html>`__.

Here are the three different available builtin types of input file:

- :class:`aiogram.types.input_file.FSInputFile` - `uploading from file system <#upload-from-file-system>`__
- :class:`aiogram.types.input_file.BufferedInputFile` - `uploading from buffer <#upload-from-buffer>`__
- :class:`aiogram.types.input_file.URLInputFile` - `uploading from URL <#upload-from-url>`__

.. warning::

    **Be respectful with Telegram**

    Instances of `InputFile` are reusable.
    That's mean you can create instance of InputFile and sent this file multiple times but Telegram
    does not recommend to do that and when you upload file once just save their `file_id`
    and use it in next times.

Upload from file system
=======================

By first step you will need to import InputFile wrapper:

.. code-block::

    from aiogram.types import FSInputFile

Then you can use it:

.. code-block::

    cat = FSInputFile("cat.png")
    agenda = FSInputFile("my-document.pdf", filename="agenda-2019-11-19.pdf")


.. autoclass:: aiogram.types.input_file.FSInputFile
    :members: __init__


Upload from buffer
==================

Files can be also passed from buffer
(For example you generate image using `Pillow <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
and you want to send it to Telegram):

Import wrapper:

.. code-block::

    from aiogram.types import BufferedInputFile

And then you can use it:

.. code-block::

    text_file = BufferedInputFile(b"Hello, world!", filename="file.txt")

.. autoclass:: aiogram.types.input_file.BufferedInputFile
    :members: __init__

Upload from url
===============

If you need to upload a file from another server, but the direct link is bound to your server's IP,
or you want to bypass native `upload limits <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sending-files>`_
by URL, you can use :obj:`aiogram.types.input_file.URLInputFile`.

Import wrapper:

.. code-block::

    from aiogram.types import URLInputFile

And then you can use it:

.. code-block::

    image = URLInputFile(
        "https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-powered-h-140x182.png",
        filename="python-logo.png"
    )

.. autoclass:: aiogram.types.input_file.URLInputFile
    :members:
