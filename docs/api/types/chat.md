# Chat

## Description

This object represents a chat.


## Attributes

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `id` | `#!python int` | Unique identifier for this chat. This number may be greater than 32 bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it is smaller than 52 bits, so a signed 64 bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier. |
| `type` | `#!python str` | Type of chat, can be either 'private', 'group', 'supergroup' or 'channel' |
| `title` | `#!python Optional[str]` | Optional. Title, for supergroups, channels and group chats |
