Bot instance can be created from :code:`aiogram.Bot` (:code:`from aiogram import Bot`) and
you can't use methods without instance of bot with configured token.

This class has aliases for all methods and named in :code:`lower_camel_case`.

For example :code:`sendMessage` named :code:`send_message` and has the same specification with all class-based methods.
