          currency=Currency.USD,
          ...
      )
  `#1194 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1194>`_

Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added documentation for webhook and polling modes.
  `#1241 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1241>`_


Misc
----

- Reworked InputFile reading, removed :code:`__aiter__` method, added `bot: Bot` argument to
  the :code:`.read(...)` method, so, from now URLInputFile can be used without specifying
  bot instance.
  `#1238 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1238>`_
- Code-generated :code:`__init__` typehints in types and methods to make IDE happy without additional pydantic plugin

3.0.0b9 (2023-07-30)
=====================

Features
--------

- Added new shortcuts for :class:`aiogram.types.chat_member_updated.ChatMemberUpdated`
  to send message to chat that member joined/left.

- Added model validation to remove UNSET before field validation.
  This change was necessary to correctly handle parse_mode where 'UNSET' is used as a sentinel value.
  Without the removal of 'UNSET', it would create issues when passed to model initialization from Bot.method_name.
  'UNSET' was also added to typing.
  `#1233 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1233>`_
- Updated pydantic to 2.1 with few bugfixes


Improved Documentation
----------------------

  This is to avoid the use of the context instance in the wrong place.
  `#1230 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1230>`_


3.0.0b8 (2023-07-17)
=====================

Features
--------

- Added possibility to use custom events in routers (If router does not support custom event it does not break and passes it to included routers).
  `#1147 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1147>`_
- Added support for FSM in Forum topics.

  The strategy can be changed in dispatcher:

  .. code-block:: python

      from aiogram.fsm.strategy import FSMStrategy
      ...
      dispatcher = Dispatcher(
          fsm_strategy=FSMStrategy.USER_IN_TOPIC,
          storage=...,  # Any persistent storage
      )

  .. note::

      If you have implemented you own storages you should extend record key generation
      with new one attribute - :code:`thread_id`
  `#1161 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1161>`_
- Improved CallbackData serialization.

  - Minimized UUID (hex without dashes)
  - Replaced bool values with int (true=1, false=0)
  `#1163 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1163>`_

- Made :code:`allowed_updates` list to revolve automatically in start_polling method if not set explicitly.
  `#1178 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1178>`_
- Added possibility to pass custom headers to :class:`URLInputFile` object
  `#1191 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1191>`_


Bugfixes
--------

- Change type of result in InlineQueryResult enum for :code:`InlineQueryResultCachedMpeg4Gif`
  and :code:`InlineQueryResultMpeg4Gif` to more correct according to documentation.

  Change regexp for entities parsing to more correct (:code:`InlineQueryResultType.yml`).
  `#1146 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1146>`_
- Fixed signature of startup/shutdown events to include the :code:`**dispatcher.workflow_data` as the handler arguments.
  `#1155 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1155>`_
- Added missing :code:`FORUM_TOPIC_EDITED` value to content_type property
  `#1160 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1160>`_
- Fixed compatibility with Python 3.8-3.9 (from previous release)
  `#1162 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1162>`_

  `#1176 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1176>`_
- Fixed workflow data propagation
  `#1196 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1196>`_
- Fixed the serialization error associated with nested subtypes
  like InputMedia, ChatMember, etc.

  The previously generated code resulted in an invalid schema under pydantic v2,
  which has stricter type parsing.
  Hence, subtypes without the specification of all subtype unions were generating
  an empty object. This has been rectified now.
  `#1213 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1213>`_


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Changed small grammar typos for :code:`upload_file`
  `#1133 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1133>`_

  Use :code:`F.text` instead
  `#1170 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1170>`_


Misc
----

- Added full support of `Bot API 6.6 <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api-changelog#march-9-2023>`_

  .. danger::

      Note that this issue has breaking changes described in in the Bot API changelog,
      this changes is not breaking in the API but breaking inside aiogram because

  `#1210 <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram/issues/1210>`_
- Updated magic-filter with new features

  - Added hint for :code:`len(F)` error

3.0.0b7 (2023-02-18)
=====================

.. warning::

    Note that this version has incompatibility with Python 3.8-3.9 in case when you create an instance of Dispatcher outside of the any coroutine.

    Sorry for the inconvenience, it will be fixed in the next version.

    This code will not work:

    .. code-block:: python

        dp = Dispatcher()

        def main():
            ...
            dp.run_polling(...)

        main()

    But if you change it like this it should works as well:

    .. code-block:: python

        router = Router()

        async def main():
            dp = Dispatcher()
            dp.include_router(router)
            ...

        asyncio.run(main())
