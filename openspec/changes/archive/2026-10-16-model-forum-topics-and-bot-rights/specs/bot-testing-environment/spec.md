## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Topic refusals use Telegram's wording

A Bot API call naming a thread the forum never had SHALL fail with
`message thread not found`, and one naming a topic `deleteForumTopic` removed SHALL fail
with `TOPIC_DELETED`. A topic a test or an actor names that the chat lacks SHALL be a setup
error that lists the chat's topics, never a Telegram error.

#### Scenario: Posting into an unknown thread

- **WHEN** a handler sends a message with a thread id the forum never had
- **THEN** the call raises `TelegramBadRequest` with `message thread not found`

#### Scenario: Posting into a deleted topic

- **WHEN** a handler deletes a topic and then posts into it
- **THEN** the call raises `TelegramBadRequest` with `TOPIC_DELETED`

#### Scenario: A test names an unknown topic

- **WHEN** a test binds an actor to a thread id the chat does not have
- **THEN** it raises `WorldLookupError` naming the topics the chat has
