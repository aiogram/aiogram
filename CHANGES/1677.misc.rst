Fixed MyPy [return-value] error in `InlineKeyboardBuilder().as_markup()`.
`as_markup` method now overloads parent class method and uses `super()`, to call parent's 
`as_markup` method.
Also added correct type hint to `as_markup`'s return in `InlineKeyboardBuilder` and 
`ReplyKeyboardBuilder` classes.
