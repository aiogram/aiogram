Added business_connection_id to the :class:`aiogram.types.message.Message` API methods shortcuts.

Integrated the :code:`business_connection_id` attribute into various message manipulation methods,
ensuring consistent data handling. This update eliminates the need to pass the
:code:`business_connection_id` as a parameter,
instead directly accessing it from the instance attributes.
