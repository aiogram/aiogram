Resolved incorrect ordering of registered handlers in the :class:`aiogram.fsm.scene.Scene`
object caused by :code:`inspect.getmembers` returning sorted members.
Handlers are now registered in the order of their definition within the class,
ensuring proper execution sequence, especially when handling filters with different
levels of specificity.
