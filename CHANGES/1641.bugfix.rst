Resolved incorrect ordering of registered handlers in the :class:`aiogram.fsm.scene.Scene`
object caused by :code:`inspect.getmembers` returning sorted members.
Handlers are now registered in the order of their definition within the class,
ensuring proper execution sequence, especially when handling filters with different
levels of specificity.

For backward compatibility, the old behavior can be restored by setting the
:code:`attrs_resolver=inspect_members_resolver` parameter in the :class:`aiogram.fsm.scene.Scene`:

.. code-block:: python

    from aiogram.utils.class_attrs_resolver import inspect_members_resolver


    class MyScene(Scene, attrs_resolver=inspect_members_resolver):

In this case, the handlers will be registered in the order returned by :code:`inspect.getmembers`.

By default, the :code:`attrs_resolver` parameter is set to :code:`get_sorted_mro_attrs_resolver` now,
so you **don't need** to specify it explicitly.
