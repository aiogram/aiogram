Fixed the serialization error associated with nested subtypes
like InputMedia, ChatMember, etc.

The previously generated code resulted in an invalid schema under pydantic v2,
which has stricter type parsing.
Hence, subtypes without the specification of all subtype unions were generating
an empty object. This has been rectified now.
