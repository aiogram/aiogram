Checked compatibility with Python 3.13 (added to the CI/CD processes),
so now aiogram is totally compatible with it.

Dropped compatibility with Python 3.8 due to this version being `EOL <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>`_.

.. warning::

  In some cases you will need to have the installed compiler (Rust or C++)
  to install some of the dependencies to compile packages from source on `pip install` command.

  - If you are using Windows, you will need to have the `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>`_ installed.
  - If you are using Linux, you will need to have the `build-essential` package installed.
  - If you are using macOS, you will need to have the `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ installed.

  When developers of this dependencies will release new versions with precompiled wheels for Windows, Linux and macOS,
  this action will not be necessary anymore until the next version of the Python interpreter.
