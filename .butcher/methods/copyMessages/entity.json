Service messages, paid media messages, giveaway messages, giveaway winners messages, and invoice messages can't be copied. A quiz poll can be copied only if the value of the field correct_option_id is known to the bot. The method is analogous to the method forwardMessages, but the copied messages don't have a link to the original message. Album grouping is kept for copied messages. On success, an array of MessageId of the sent messages is returned.",
