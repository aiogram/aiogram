      "description": "Your bot can offer users HTML5 games to play solo or to compete against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Create games via @BotFather using the /newgame command. Please note that this kind of power requires responsibility: you will need to accept the terms for each game that your bots will be offering.\n - Games are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the Game and InlineQueryResultGame objects.\n - Once you've created a game via BotFather, you can send games to chats as regular messages using the sendGame method, or use inline mode with InlineQueryResultGame.\n - If you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play GameName' button. When this button is pressed, your bot gets a CallbackQuery with the game_short_name of the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app opens the game in the in-app browser.\n - You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row must always launch the game, using the field callback_game in InlineKeyboardButton. You can add extra buttons according to taste: e.g., for a description of the rules, or to open the game's official community.\n - To make your game more attractive, you can upload a GIF animation that demonstrates the game to the users via BotFather (see Lumberjack for example).\n - A game message will also display high scores for the current chat. Use setGameScore to post high scores to the chat with the game, add the disable_edit_message parameter to disable automatic update of the message with the current scoreboard.\n - Use getGameHighScores to get data for in-game high score tables.\n - You can also add an extra sharing button for users to share their best score to different chats.\n - For examples of what can be done using this new stuff, check the @gamebot and @gamee bots."
