            # :x: Changelog is required!

            You need to add a brief description of the changes to the `CHANGES` directory.

            Changes file should be named like `<issue or PR number>.<category>.rst`,
            example `1234.bugfix.rst` where `1234` is the PR or issue number and `bugfix` is the category.

            The content of the file should be a brief description of the changes in
            the PR in the format of a description of what has been done.

            Possible categories are: `feature`, `bugfix`, `doc`, `removal` and `misc`.

            This PR does not require a changelog because `skip news` label is present.
